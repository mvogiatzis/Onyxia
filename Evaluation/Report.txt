=========================================== Report ===========================================

This is only 3 evaluation forms from my friends, but I am happy that I had 27 downloads in Mediafire !
A lot of people enjoyed my adventure game and the comments I got were very positive.
I really enjoyed the way I built it, and the whole developing experience as well.
I managed to deliver my almost final distribution a week before the deadline, that's why the comments were
so positive, and some minor bugs were fixed.

As an improvement, I would like to put some blood when the woman is killed, and to implement more rooms in version 2, as Antoniana says.
The improvement that George Vasileiou suggests about the woman screaming sound has been now implemented !
As a future implementation, the player will continue his / her adventures after killing Onyxia the dragon and ofcourse
I will add more sounds as Zisis Anagnostou suggests. 
Also, as George suggests, it may be useful for some users to follow this way of 'use': 
Button("Use") -> JList sword -> character instead of JList sword -> Button("Use") -> character.
